# üî• Introduction
üëã Hi,there! I‚Äôm Feiyu Zhou, Currently pursuing a Doctorate degree with [Prof. Shengying Yue](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/syyue) and [Prof. Yilun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/yilunliu) in solid mechanics at [State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/2021-03/30/c_607160.htm), School of Aerospace Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China.
Simultaneously, I am a graduate student at [Cuiying Honors College](https://cycollege.lzu.edu.cn/) (China‚Äôs Top-notch Undergraduate training program 2.0), [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/). 

My long-term research interests lie in:
- Data-driven solid mechanics and solve real-world problems
- AI4Science(Chemistry, Physics Large Language models etc)

# üìïProjects

## Solving High Dimensional PDEs with BSDEs Using PyTorch
[Paper Code](https://github.com/zhoufy20/deep-bsde-pytorch)
![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhoufy20/deep-bsde-pytorch)

- Cuiying Honors College Innovation Fund Project No. 20230020105 at Lanzhou University, China (March 2023 - March 2024) and the Project supervisor is [Prof. Weihua Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hXO2ZmUAAAAJ)

- This repository contains Python scripts that implement solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) for several high-dimensional partial differential equations using PyTorch.

- We draw an analogy between BSDEs and reinforcement learning, where the gradient of the solution serves as the policy function, and the loss function is defined by the discrepancy between the specified terminal condition and the solution of the BSDE.

# üî• Introduction

üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm **Feiyu Zhou**, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in **Solid Mechanics** under the supervision of [Prof. Shengying Yue](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/syyue) and [Prof. Yilun Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/yilunliu) at the [State Key Laboratory for Strength and Vibration of Mechanical Structures](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/2021-03/30/c_607160.htm), [School of Aerospace Engineering](https://sae.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China.

At the same time, I am also a graduate student at the [Cuiying Honors College](https://cycollege.lzu.edu.cn/) of [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/)‚Äîa part of China‚Äôs **Top-notch Undergraduate Training Program 2.0**.

## üß† Research Interests

My long-term research interests lie at the intersection of solid mechanics, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence, with the overarching goal of addressing real-world engineering problems through physics-informed and data-driven approaches.

Specifically, my work focuses on:

- Data-driven solid mechanics: Leveraging machine learning and statistical methods to enhance the modeling, simulation, and design of complex mechanical systems.

- AI for Science: Developing and applying modern AI techniques‚Äîincluding graph neural networks (GNNs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), operator learning, and large language models‚Äîto accelerate scientific discovery and modeling.

- Multi-scale mechanical modeling: Bridging scales from quantum mechanics (e.g., density functional theory) and molecular dynamics to continuum mechanics and phase-field modeling, aiming to connect theoretical understanding with practical applications.

## Solving High Dimensional PDEs with BSDEs Using PyTorch
[Paper Code](https://github.com/zhoufy20/deep-bsde-pytorch)
![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhoufy20/deep-bsde-pytorch)

- Cuiying Honors College Innovation Fund Project No. 20230020105 at Lanzhou University, China (March 2023 - March 2024) and the Project supervisor is [Prof. Weihua Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hXO2ZmUAAAAJ)

- This repository contains Python scripts that implement solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) for several high-dimensional partial differential equations using PyTorch.

- We draw an analogy between BSDEs and reinforcement learning, where the gradient of the solution serves as the policy function, and the loss function is defined by the discrepancy between the specified terminal condition and the solution of the BSDE.
